This slowed progress as the TDS protocol is nuanced. For example, there are a handful of different types of tokens to be used when transmitting a token stream, each with their own rules. To add to this, not all messages transmitted are token streams. Decomposing the intricate case-work into meaningful classes has helped with understanding the protocol overall.
