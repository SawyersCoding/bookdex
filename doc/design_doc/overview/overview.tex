    Bookdex is an application from which a user may access a server database of their home library. Note, the user can not read books through Bookdex, only query their existence.

    Bookdex makes use of the TDS protocol when transmitting messages between client and server. TDS ensures the secure transmission of SQL queries and the results to those queries. TDS specifications were losely followed due to time constraints. For more information on which corners were cut, see Section~\ref{sec:dec}.
